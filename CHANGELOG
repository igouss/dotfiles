* Release 0.3.0 *

  Housekeeping
  - Support for a bunch of platforms has been added (Windows, Ubuntu, Ruby 1.9)
  - git_remote_branch now has actual online documentation: grb.rubyforge.org
  - give useful error message if grb can't find the git executable
  
  Features
  - track now works even if you already have a local branch of the same name
    - it uses git config instead of branch --track in that case
    - the difference can be seen by running
      - grb explain track master
      - grb explain track non_existent_branch
  - Let you force the usage of a specific git executable by setting the environment variable GRB_GIT to point to it. It's pretty much undocumented for now, except for this mention :-) The tests for the useful error message use this feature. So it works.

* Release 0.2.6 *
  Three new actual features
  - grb rename, contributed by Caio Chassot (caiochassot.com)
  - grb publish, to make available and track a local branch
  - the --silent option, if you want to use grb in a script
  
  And other stuff
  - the grb bin file now works when symlinked (also thanks to Caio Chassot)
  - Lots and lots of unit and functional tests
  - bug fixes
  - more flexibility for running grb outside of a git repository (e.g. for 'explain' or 'help')
  - Now officially under the MIT license
  - refactored a bunch of rake tasks
